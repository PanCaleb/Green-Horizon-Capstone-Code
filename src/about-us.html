                The founders of L.T. Services, Inc., created the company in 1982 with one simple objective in mind: to provide high-quality and flexible management at reasonable costs to commercial and government organizations. As simple as this 
                objective was, it has encompassed the corporate culture at L.T. Services, and affected all major corporate decisions made by our organization in the past 20 plus years. We are happy to report that this tradition is very much alive.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">	
                To ensure high-quality services, L.T. Services employs staff members who are highly trained in various areas of expertise. We periodically update our work force knowledge on new techniques and provide profit sharing as an incentive for excellent performance. Our managers monitor the work daily to ensure that they have taken special care to give clients a hassle free 
                environment. We are currently managing housekeeping projects totaling more than 4.8 million square feet of net cleaning space including, Federal Government, State and local government properties, higher education institutions, medical centers, and a large number of commercial office buildings in Metropolitan Areas. These properties range from 40,000 to 1.2 million square 
                feet of net cleaning space in a single facility. We are currently employing more than 150 employees and 25 professional management staff.
